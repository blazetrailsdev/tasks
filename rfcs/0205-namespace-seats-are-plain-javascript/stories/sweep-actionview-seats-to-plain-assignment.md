## Context

actionview holds 64 seats and 21 deferred reads, with **zero module-eval
reads**, so the package should end with no framework namespace read at all. 35
of the seats are onto `ActionView::Helpers::Tags`, the rest onto
`ActionView` and `Serializers`; 11 seats are in `*.test.ts` files and
belong to the test-file story.

One seat keeps the helper: `Types`
(`actionview/lib/action_view/template.rb:189`,
`const_set(:Types, implementation)`).

`Tags` is read by `form-helper`-family modules that the tag classes in turn
import, so expect a cycle cluster here and rely on the entry-module check
rather than reasoning about it.

## Converting a read

A read inside a function or method body becomes a plain ES import, correct even
inside a cycle:

```ts
import { Nodes } from "../namespaces.js";   // before
not() { return new Nodes.Not(this); }

import { Not } from "./unary.js";           // after
not() { return new Not(this); }
```

A read at module-eval time — an `extends` clause, a top-level call, a
top-level `new` — keeps the namespace read and is listed in the PR body with
its reason. A TypeScript type position (`T extends Nodes.X`, `: Nodes.X`)
becomes `import type`, which is erased and costs no edge.

A seat `rbModConstSet(Owner, "Name", Klass)` is deleted where nothing reads
the namespace property any more. Where a module-eval read remains, the seat
becomes a plain `Owner.Name = Klass` assignment, which is type-checked where
the three-argument helper was not. A seat mirroring a Rails `const_set` from
the RFC's 18-site table keeps the helper and cites its Ruby site.

Enumerate with `grep -rn 'rbModConstSet(' --include=*.ts <paths>` for the
seats, and the RFC's deferred/module-eval classification for the reads.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Every deferred read in scope is a plain ES import; every remaining
      namespace read is module-eval-time and listed in the PR body with its
      reason.
- [ ] Every seat in scope is deleted, or is a plain assignment serving a
      remaining module-eval read, or mirrors a cited Rails `const_set`.
- [ ] No `rbModConstSet` import remains in a file with no such call, and no
      `namespaces.js` import remains in a file with no namespace read.
- [ ] `pnpm typecheck` passes with no namespace-object type widened to admit
      a seat, and no new `any` or cast introduced to make an import type-check.
- [ ] **The built `dist/**.js` modules load as plain-node ESM entry modules,
      each package entry and each converted module tried as the entry\*\* — the
      check CLAUDE.md § "Call-time constant resolution" prescribes. A vitest
      run enters a funnel module first and masks a TDZ, so a green suite is not
      evidence here. This is the acceptance test for "the read was deferred
      after all".
- [ ] `rbModName` answers the same qualified path for every class in scope as
      the pre-conversion snapshot from the generated-table story.
- [ ] The touched test files pass; no full-suite run (CLAUDE.md "Working in
      this repo").
