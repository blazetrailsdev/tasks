## Context

`assertions-activesupport-time-ext` (trails#7847) converged the part of
`vendor/rails/activesupport/test/core_ext/time_ext_test.rb` that the current
`@blazetrails/date` surface can express. The remaining rows need port work first:

- `advance gregorian proleptic` (:673-680): `Time#advance` does
  `to_date.gregorian.advance` (`core_ext/time/calculations.rb:205`), but
  `packages/date/src/time.ts` `toDate()` returns a `Temporal.PlainDate`, not a Ruby
  Date, so the `.gregorian` call is dropped in `core-ext/time/calculations.ts:197`.
- `sec fraction` / `floor` / `ceil` (:112-149): `Time#subsec` returns a Float, where
  Ruby's is a Rational. `Time#floor`/`#ceil` are unported.
- `advance` (:615-617): `Time.new(..., ActiveSupport::TimeZone["Moscow"])` ignores the zone.
- `at with in option` (:1191): `Time.at(31337, in: -28800)`.
- `change preserves fractional seconds on zoned time` (:528): `Time#inspect`.
- `to datetime` (:893): `DateTime#start`.
- `since with instance of time deprecated` (:285): the `rescue TypeError` deprecation arm of `since` (`calculations.rb:225-234`).

## A converged assertion that fails is a story, not a detour

Converging a test's assertions regularly surfaces a real production bug: the
test now asserts what Rails asserts, and the port does not do it. **Do not fix
the production code in this PR.** That is what has been slowing this RFC down —
an assertion burndown turns into an unrelated behaviour fix, the PR triples in
size and review rounds, and the rest of the story's files stall behind it.

Instead:

1. **Land the converged body.** The assertions stay exactly as Rails writes
   them — same count, same kinds, same expected values. Do not soften an
   assertion to make it pass, and do not delete it.
2. **Park the test**, converged body intact, as `it.skip` carrying the repo's
   structured skip annotation (`scripts/test-compare/normalize-skips.ts:10-15`)
   with the story you filed named in `SCOPE:`:

   ```ts
   it.skip("rails test name, unchanged", async () => {
     // BLOCKED: <category> — <what the port does instead>
     // ROOT-CAUSE: <file>#<symbol> not implementing <behavior>
     // SCOPE: filed as <rfc>/<story-slug>
     // ...converged body, mirroring the Rails assertions...
   });
   ```

3. **File the story** in **RFC `0155-assertion-surfaced-port-bugs`**, the
   bucket this RFC's overflow goes to:

   ```bash
   pnpm tasks new 0155-assertion-surfaced-port-bugs <slug> --body-file <path>
   ```

   Not this RFC, which owns the assertion axis only. (If an active RFC already
   owns that behaviour, file it there instead and say so — 0155 is the default,
   not a monopoly.) Capture the trails and Rails `file:line` you already have in
   front of you; a title-only stub forces an expensive re-derivation later.

4. **Move on to the next file in the story.**

Prefer `it.skip` with the converged body over `it.todo`: `it.todo` takes no
body, so the mirroring work would be thrown away and redone when the bug is
fixed.

Two mechanical consequences to know before doing this:

- A pending test (`it.skip` / `it.todo`) is excluded from all three assertion
  counters — `isAssertionCountMismatch`, `assertionKindMismatch` and the value
  check all return early on `pending`
  (`scripts/test-compare/compare.ts:526-560`). Parking a test therefore clears
  its rows the same way converging it does, and the name gate still credits it:
  `matched++` runs regardless of pending (`compare.ts:920-928`), so
  `parity:test`'s percent does not drop.
- **Keep the gate wrapper.** If the Rails test is adapter-conditional
  (`current_adapter?(...)`) and you replace a gated trails test with a bare
  `it.skip`, `classifyGateMismatch` scores it `should-gate`
  (`scripts/test-compare/gates.ts:410-424`) and the `Test comparison` CI step
  fails hard — activerecord's gate-mismatch count is a hard zero with no
  baseline. Park it _inside_ its existing `describeIfPg` / `it.skipIf` gate.

Use judgement on size: a one-line production fix you are already sure of is not
worth a story round-trip. Anything needing its own investigation, its own
regression test, or a change outside the file you are converging, is.

## Acceptance criteria

- `core_ext/time_ext_test.rb` reports 0 count/kind/value mismatches in
  `pnpm parity:test -- --assertions --package activesupport`.
- The mark file is FROZEN for this RFC by
  `scripts/test-compare/assertion-mismatch-mark.freeze`: do NOT run
  `pnpm parity:test:assertions:reseed` and do NOT hand-edit
  `assertion-mismatch-mark.json`. The gate stays green while the mark carries
  slack; `tighten-assertion-mark-after-0132` lowers it once at the end.
- A converged assertion that fails because of a production bug is parked
  `it.skip` with the structured annotation and a filed story — see "A
  converged assertion that fails is a story, not a detour" above — not fixed
  in this PR.
- **Or the split is filed.** A file listed above that this PR does not take to
  0 is named, with its residue re-measured, in a remainder story filed under
  this RFC — see "Finish the story or split it" above. The converged subset plus
  a filed remainder satisfies this story; converged commits with no PR do not.
