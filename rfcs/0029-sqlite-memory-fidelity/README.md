# RFC 0029 — SQLite `:memory:` test fidelity

## Summary

The AR test suite reaches for SQLite `:memory:` in ~75 source locations
(327 raw occurrences across `packages/activerecord/src/**/*.ts`). In Rails,
`:memory:` is **not** the default — it is a specific, opt-in connection
profile (`sqlite3_mem`, selected via `ARCONN=sqlite3_mem`). Rails' default
`sqlite3` connection is **file-backed**
(`FIXTURES_ROOT/fixture_database.sqlite3` + `fixture_database_2.sqlite3`),
and Rails' own test suite hardcodes `database: ":memory:"` in only **10 test
files**. Everywhere else, Rails tests run against the ambient, file-backed
`arunit`/`arunit2` connections.

This RFC audits every trails `:memory:` site against its Rails counterpart and
converges the divergences. The good news up front: the **default worker DB is
already file-backed** in the primary CI path (the globalSetup template-clone
gives each worker an on-disk DB — see [Design](#design)), so the foundational
fidelity property is intact. The divergences are (1) a latent `:memory:`
_fallback_ default in the worker-DB plumbing plus a stale comment that
mis-describes it, and (2) a cluster of individual test files that hardcode
`:memory:` connections where the matching Rails test uses the ambient
file-backed connection or — in the multi-database cases — explicit on-disk
file paths.

## Motivation

Fidelity is the project's #1 rule (see `CLAUDE.md`, RFC 0019). `:memory:`
hides behaviors that a file-backed SQLite DB exercises and that Rails' default
suite therefore exercises: real disk I/O, WAL journaling, durability/`fsync`,
`ATTACH`/multi-database wiring, and cross-connection visibility. A test that
passes only because every connection secretly shares (or secretly cannot
share) one process-local in-memory DB is not testing what Rails tests.

Concrete evidence — Rails uses `:memory:` in exactly these test files
(`grep -rl ':memory:' vendor/rails/activerecord/test/cases/`):

Two decisive contrasts found while auditing:

- **`connection_swapping_nested_test.rb`** builds its four databases with
  on-disk paths — `"adapter" => "sqlite3", "database" => "test/db/primary.sqlite3"`,
  `.../secondary.sqlite3`, etc. (lines 51–54). trails'
  `connection-swapping-nested.test.ts` hardcodes `database: ":memory:"` for all
  four (36 occurrences). Rails uses files **deliberately** here so the four
  pools address genuinely distinct databases; `:memory:` makes that test weaker.
- **`connection_pool_test.rb` / `adapter_test.rb`** never name a database — they
  derive their config from the ambient pool
  (`ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.db_config`, `lease_connection`,
  `establish_connection :arunit`) and merge options onto it (lines 20–29, 13,
  163–189). trails' `connection-pool.test.ts` / `adapter.test.ts` hardcode
  `:memory:` instead, which means they never run against the file-backed default
  the way Rails does.

## Design

### The default worker DB is already file-backed (verified)

`AR_TEST_WORKER_DB` defaults to `:memory:` in
`test-helpers/test-database-config.ts:39,102` — but in the live CI path that
default is **never reached**. The `activerecord` vitest project wires
`globalSetup: template-global-setup.ts`, whose SQLite adapter builds the
canonical schema into an on-disk template file and provisions per-worker
clones; `test-setup-worker-db.ts:155` calls `ensureWorkerClone()` and stamps
the resulting **file path** into `AR_TEST_WORKER_DB`. So every worker in a
normal `pnpm vitest run packages/activerecord/` invocation runs against an
on-disk per-worker `.sqlite` file (`ar-test-worker-<token>-<slot>.sqlite`),
which matches Rails' file-backed `sqlite3` profile in spirit (real disk I/O,
WAL, durability).

Two residual gaps remain:

1. **The fallback default is `:memory:`.** If globalSetup did not provision
   (template build skipped, a setup-free code path, or a future refactor),
   `getEnv("AR_TEST_WORKER_DB") ?? ":memory:"` silently drops back to in-memory
   instead of a file. The fallback should itself be file-backed so the suite
   never silently loses fidelity.
2. **A stale comment asserts the wrong thing.** `vitest.config.ts:206` reads
   _"SQLite uses :memory: which is isolated per fork by default."_ That is no
   longer true — workers use on-disk clones. Misleading comments cause exactly
   the kind of wrong mental model this RFC exists to correct.

Per-worker file isolation here is a trails parallelism adaptation (Rails runs
its file DBs at lower fork counts); file-backed-ness is the fidelity property,
per-worker pathing is acceptable infra. **Interaction with the shared-worker-DB
flake work** (the items/posts/people/accounts shared-table flakes tracked in
memory + RFC 0019): the worker-DB stories here must not change the per-worker
_isolation_ model — each worker keeps its own file. Sequence the fallback
change (`worker-db-fallback-file-backed`) so it does not race those flake
fixes; it is additive (fallback only) and should not move the primary path, but
it touches the same plumbing, so it is flagged.

### Classification method

For each trails `:memory:` site: (a) find the Rails counterpart test via the
file-structure manifest / `test:compare` naming, (b) check whether that Rails
file uses `:memory:`/`sqlite3_mem` in the corresponding location, (c) classify:

- **fidelity-correct** — Rails uses `:memory:` there too → leave untouched.
- **divergence** — Rails uses a file-backed DB (ambient `arunit` or explicit
  on-disk path) there → write a convergence story.
- **trails-only** — no Rails counterpart; judge against the nearest Rails
  convention. trails' driver-abstraction layer (`sqlite/*`, `sqlite-adapter`)
  and the `establishConnection` API tests legitimately use `:memory:` as a
  no-disk fixture and are left alone.

### Divergence map

`✓` = fidelity-correct (leave), `✗` = divergence (story), `~` = trails-only /
partial (judge / verify). Counts are `:memory:` occurrences per file.

### Scope boundary

This RFC covers **test + test-helper** `:memory:` usage only. Source files that
_implement_ `:memory:` handling (the SQLite adapter's special-casing of the
in-memory database name, URL parsing, database-tasks no-op-on-`:memory:`
branches) are Rails-faithful production behavior and are explicitly out of
scope.

The audit is **one-directional** — it asks "where _trails_ uses `:memory:`,
does Rails?" The reverse direction (Rails uses `:memory:` where trails does
not) is out of scope but was observed and is recorded here so it is not
mistaken for a clean bidirectional match: Rails' `database_configurations_test.rb`
(2 sites) has a trails counterpart `database-configurations.test.ts` that uses
**no** `:memory:`; `migration/foreign_key_test.rb:625` and
`fixtures_test.rb:606` (`ENV["DATABASE_URL"] = "sqlite3::memory:"`) likewise have
no `:memory:` in their trails equivalents. These are config/URL-parsing cases
where `:memory:` is often the fidelity-correct value to _add_. They are
candidate follow-ups, not stories in this RFC; flag them to a future
reverse-direction sweep (or `0023-surfaced-deviations`) rather than widening
this RFC's trails→Rails scope.

## Alternatives considered

- **Flip `AR_TEST_WORKER_DB` default to a file and call it done.** Rejected as
  insufficient: the default is already effectively file-backed via globalSetup,
  so this alone changes nothing observable, and it ignores the ~60 individual
  test-file divergences that are the substance of the fidelity gap.
- **Bulk sed `:memory:` → file path.** Rejected: many sites are
  fidelity-correct (the 10 Rails files + driver layer + API tests). A blind
  rewrite would _introduce_ divergence and break the driver/`establishConnection`
  tests that legitimately use `:memory:`. Each site must be judged against its
  Rails counterpart.
- **One mega-PR.** Rejected: violates the trails 500-LOC ceiling and the
  one-agent-per-PR model. Split per file/area.

## Rollout

1. **Foundational** — `worker-db-fallback-file-backed` (sequence away from
   shared-DB flake work; additive).
2. **High-value, isolated** — `connection-swapping-nested-file-based` (biggest
   single-file divergence; Rails uses explicit file paths).
3. **Ambient-connection cluster** (independent, one file each, parallelizable) —
   `adapter-test-ambient-connection`, `connection-pool-derive-from-ambient`,
   `connection-handling-ambient-connection`, `statement-cache-ambient-connection`,
   `transactions-ambient-connection`, `sqlite3-statement-pool-ambient`,
   `schema-statements-on-adapter-ambient`.
4. **Larger single file** — `database-tasks-test-config-fidelity` (28 excess
   sites; keep under 500 LOC, split via a follow-up story if needed).
5. **Sweep** — `audit-residual-memory-sites` runs first within its own scope to
   classify the long tail and the partial-audit files (multi-db / sharding count
   deltas, legacy sqlite3-adapter path), spinning convergence stories for any
   real divergence it finds.

## Open questions

1. **Per-worker file path vs Rails' fixed `FIXTURES_ROOT` path.** Rails uses two
   fixed files; trails uses per-worker tmp clones for parallelism. Recommendation:
   keep per-worker pathing (it is infra, not behavior) — the fidelity property is
   file-backed-ness, which is preserved.
2. **Should the ambient-connection stories share a helper?** Several files would
   converge to the same "derive a HashConfig from the live test config and merge
   options" pattern. Recommendation: let the first ambient story
   (`adapter-test-ambient-connection`) introduce the helper if one is warranted;
   later stories reuse it. Do not pre-build an empty helper (CLAUDE.md: no stubs).
