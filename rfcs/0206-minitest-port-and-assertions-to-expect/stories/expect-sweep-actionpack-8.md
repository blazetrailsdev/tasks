## Context

One bin of the RFC's test-code sweep (§ "Per-helper disposition", § "What a
sweep must not do"). These 2 test files make 293 calls to Minitest
helpers imported from `@blazetrails/activesupport` or a relative
`testing/assertions.js` (count: the import-resolved command in the RFC's
§ Measurements, run 2026-10-22 on trails `1b769d8daa`). Per file, helper and
call count:

- `packages/actionpack/src/action-dispatch/dispatch/request.test.ts` (292: assert 8, assertEqual 206, assertNil 16, assertNotNil 1, assertMatch 9, assertEmpty 1, assertSame 1, assertInstanceOf 2, assertKindOf 1, assertPredicate 26, assertNotPredicate 21)
- `packages/actionpack/src/action-dispatch/dispatch/request/url-encoded-params-parsing.test.ts` (1: assertEqual 1)

Each helper's replacement and the question to ask at each site are in the
RFC's disposition table. The Ruby being ported is in
`vendor/minitest/v5.27.0/lib/minitest/assertions.rb`; CONTRIBUTING.md
§ "Porting a Minitest assertion" is the ratified table.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] No file listed above imports or calls a Minitest assertion helper
      (`assert`, `assertEqual`, `assertNil`, `assertPredicate`, `assertEmpty`,
      `assertMatch`, `assertRespondTo`, … and their negations). Rails'
      `ActiveSupport::Testing::Assertions` members (`assertNot`,
      `assertRaises`, `assertNothingRaised`, `assertDifference`,
      `assertChanges`, …) are untouched.
- [ ] Each call becomes exactly one `expect`, chosen per the RFC table:
      the built-in by default, an existing `@blazetrails/vitest-matchers`
      matcher (existing, or the RFC's `toBeKindOf` / `toInclude`) only where
      the built-in is wrong for that value.
- [ ] `assertNil` / `assertNotNil` map to the JS value the code under test
      produces: `toBeNull` / `.not.toBeNull` for `null`,
      `toBeUndefined` / `toBeDefined` for `undefined`. A value that can be
      both is filed against the package's `surfaced-deviations` RFC, not
      papered over.
- [ ] `assertPredicate` / `assert` sites on a value that can be `0` or
      `""` use `toBeRubyTruthy`; `assertEqual` sites where either side
      defines Ruby `==` use `toEqualRuby`; an async `isEmpty` /
      `isInclude` is awaited before the matcher.
- [ ] No `describe` / `it` / `test` title changes:
      `git diff -U0 origin/main... | rg '^[-+].*\b(it|describe|test)(\.\w+)?\("'` shows no
      title line.
- [ ] Every touched file passes `pnpm vitest run <file>`.
- [ ] `pnpm parity:test` then `pnpm parity:test:assertions` green: no
      package's count, kind or value counter rises.

## Definition of done

A file left half-converted does not close this story, and neither does a
`toBeTruthy` on a value that can be `0` or `""` because the test went green.
