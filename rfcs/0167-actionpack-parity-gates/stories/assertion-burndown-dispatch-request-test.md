## Context

Filed by `triage-actionpack-assertion-mismatches` from `pnpm parity:test:assertions` on trails `main` @ `94b071b93d` (2026-10-17). Counts are the number of matched tests per file with a mismatch: `assert` = assertion count, `kind` = assertion-kind multiset, `value` = asserted literal values (`scripts/test-compare/output/convention-comparison.json`). `unmapped` is how many kind rows involve an assertion test-compare does not map; those are tooling gaps tracked by `assertion-kinds-map-actionpack-test-assertions`, not divergence.

- `vendor/rails/v8.0.2/actionpack/test/dispatch/request_test.rb:1-1448` → `packages/actionpack/src/action-dispatch/dispatch/request.test.ts`: assert 30, kind 50, value 13, unmapped 0

## Acceptance criteria

- Re-measure each file with `pnpm parity:test:assertions`; counts will have moved as sibling ports land.
- Each mismatch that is a real divergence (trails asserting less, or a different kind or value, than Rails) is converged by porting the Rails assertion.
- A mismatch caused by an unmapped assertion helper is left to the mapping story, not worked around in the test.
- `pnpm parity:test:assertions` shows 0 divergence rows for these files, and the marks in `scripts/test-compare/assertion-mismatch-mark.json` are tightened.
