## Context

Part of RFC 0030-ar-test-compare-residual-burndown (test:compare residual burndown). primary-key residuals (untagged — triage; likely CPK / custom-pk dump).

**9** `it.skip` tests to un-skip across 1 file(s) (deduped; permanent-skips — Marshal/YAML/thread/fork/Rational — excluded). For reference, `test:compare` reports **9** `matchedSkipped` for these files (snapshot 2026-06-15); any delta is permanent/​gated skips not on the un-skip list.

### Root causes (from `BLOCKED:`/`ROOT-CAUSE:` skip tags)

_Untagged — first task is to triage each skip and record a ROOT-CAUSE comment in the test file._

### Skipped tests to un-skip

- `primary_keys_test.rb` → `primary-keys.test.ts` — **9** to un-skip:
  - primary key returns nil if it does not exist
  - assign id raises error if primary key doesnt exist
  - schema dump primary key includes type and options
  - schema typed primary key column
  - collectly dump composite primary key
  - dumping composite primary key out of order
  - schema dump primary key integer with default nil
  - schema dump primary key bigint with default nil
  - schema dump primary key with serial/integer

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Every test listed above is un-skipped (`it.skip` → `it`) and passes against the canonical SQLite adapter (and PG/MySQL where the ruby gate applies).
- [ ] `pnpm test:compare --package activerecord` shows these files with no `it.skip`-based `matchedSkipped` (any residual reclassified to a permanent-skip with a recorded reason per the RFC Deferred table).
- [ ] No new gate-mismatches introduced for these files.
- [ ] Refresh the RFC snapshot count after merge.
