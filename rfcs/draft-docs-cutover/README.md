# RFC — Full cutover: retire `trails/docs`, make `tasks` the only source of truth

## Summary

The `tasks` repo was created (late May 2026) to be the single source of truth
for work tracking, but the migration off `trails/docs/` only ever happened for
three AR gap docs (→ RFC 0005). The big driver docs never moved, and the
stories that _did_ move were never reconciled against what shipped. Today there
are **two competing sources of truth**: ~38 live plan/tracker docs in
`trails/docs/` (still authored, still authoritative for ordering) and ~65 RFC
stories here (status mostly stale). This RFC plans the full cutover — reconcile
the existing RFCs against reality, migrate every actionable doc into RFCs/
stories, **delete** the docs, and add guardrails so work can only ever flow
from one place again.

## Motivation

**Two sources of truth, drifting apart.**

_Tasks side (stale):_ across RFCs 0001–0010 the story status breakdown is **4
done / 39 ready / 15 draft / 11 blocked**. Yet a large fraction of the "ready"
and "blocked" items have already shipped in trails — e.g. ConnectionHandler
(Story 4.1), nested-through associations, association callbacks, query-logs
parity, and most adapter buckets (M-1..M-4, P-1/P-3/P-6/P-9) are all merged on
`main`. The ready queue is full of phantom work; `tasks ready` can't be trusted.

_Trails side (authoritative, but should not be):_ `trails/docs/` still holds
~38 plan/tracker docs. `workplan.md` was reconciled **2026-06-02**;
`test-compare-100-attack-plan.md` openly declares itself "authoritative for what
order to do things in." New work keeps getting authored against these docs, so
every edit there widens the gap with the RFCs that were supposed to replace
them.

**Why it festers:** the first-batch migration was partial. Only
`associations-gap-plan.md` / `connection-pool-gap-plan.md` /
`relation-gap-plan.md` were lifted (into RFC 0005); the high-traffic drivers
(`workplan.md`, the attack plan, the `*-100-plan.md` trackers) stayed put, and
nobody closed the loop on the stories that moved. Until the docs are physically
gone and a guardrail forbids re-adding them, the two-SoT split self-heals back
into existence.

## Design

**Principle:** after cutover, `trails/docs/` contains **no work-tracking
content**. Every actionable item lives as a story under an RFC here; ordering,
deferred items, and permanent-skips live in RFC prose (the RFC 0005 §Deferred
pattern). The `pnpm tasks` CLI + this repo's indices are the only queue. The
docs are deleted outright — no stub pointers (a stub is just a smaller second
source of truth).

Four phases, each its own cluster.

### Phase 1 — Reconcile the existing 10 RFCs (`reconcile`)

Before importing anything new, make the current RFCs trustworthy.

1. **Build reconcile tooling** (`reconcile-tooling`). A script that, for every
   story, gathers shipped-signals and emits a triage report
   (`likely-done` / `likely-open` / `unknown`):
   - `pr:` frontmatter already set → confirm the PR is merged.
   - Match story id / title / source anchors against the **trails merged-PR
     log** (`gh pr list --state merged` + `git log` keyword/anchor search).
   - `test:compare` / `api:compare` current deltas vs the story's acceptance
     criteria (a closed gap ⇒ likely done).
   - Seed the obvious AR cases from the persistent memory index, which already
     records shipped PRs per feature.
2. **Run + apply** (`reconcile-existing-rfcs`). Auto-flip `likely-done` stories
   to `done` (with their PR), spot-check manually, re-verify every `blocked`
   story's blocker still exists, and set RFC status to `closed` where all
   stories are done. Expectation: several of 0001–0010 close outright.

Validation order (per decision): **automated reconcile first, then manual** for
the residue the script marks `unknown`.

### Phase 2 — Migrate the authoritative docs (`migrate`)

One new RFC per doc cluster (authored `draft-*` → PR → numbered at merge, the
normal flow). Actionable items become stories; design/ordering/deferred prose
stays in the RFC body. Priority order: P0/P1 first.

**Full disposition of `trails/docs/`** (every file gets an action):

| Doc                                                      | Action                       | Target RFC / story                                                                            |

Each migration story is "author RFC X from doc(s) Y, converting actionable
items to dep-aware stories; record deferred/permanent-skip in §Deferred." A
doc is **not** deleted in Phase 3 until its target RFC is merged and reconciled.

### Phase 3 — Decommission `trails/docs` (`decommission`)

1. `decommission-docs` — delete each migrated doc + `docs/index.md`
   (deps: the doc's migration story). No stubs.
2. `repoint-references` — update everything in trails that points at `docs/`:
   `README.md` links, `CLAUDE.md` "Measuring progress" section, any skills /
   the spawn-loop (`tasks/tooling/tasks-loop`) so they read the tasks index,
   not `docs/`.

### Phase 4 — Guardrails (`guardrails`)

`drift-prevention-ci` — a CI check in trails that **fails on any new or edited
`docs/**/\*.md`work-tracking file** (allowlist whatever reference docs survive
the Phase-2 open question). Plus a`CLAUDE.md`working-principles edit: "all
work tracking lives in the`tasks`repo; pick work via`pnpm tasks`, never by
hand-editing a plan doc." Without this, the two-SoT split returns.

## Alternatives considered

- **Stub pointers instead of deletion.** Rejected per decision — a stub is a
  smaller second source of truth and invites re-expansion. Delete outright.
- **Migrate docs first, reconcile later.** Rejected — importing un-reconciled
  docs would multiply the phantom-work problem across new RFCs. Reconcile the
  existing 10 first so the importer has a clean baseline and a working
  done-detection script to reuse.
- **One mega-RFC for all remaining docs.** Rejected — violates the per-cluster
  RFC model and would be unreviewable. One RFC per doc cluster, P0/P1 first.
- **Pure manual audit of all 65 stories.** Rejected per decision — automated
  reconcile first (PR-log + compare deltas + memory seed), manual only for the
  `unknown` residue.

## Rollout

1. **Phase 1 — reconcile:** `reconcile-tooling` → `reconcile-existing-rfcs`.
2. **Phase 2 — migrate** (parallel, P0/P1 first): `migrate-ar-test-compare`,
   `migrate-ar-followups`, `migrate-adapter-ci`, `migrate-fixtures`,
   `migrate-schema-ts`, `migrate-actionpack`, `migrate-actionview`,
   `migrate-rack`, `migrate-activesupport`, `migrate-html-sanitizer`,
   `migrate-system-testing`, `migrate-trailties`, `migrate-infra`,
   `migrate-frontiers`, `migrate-launch-roadmap`.
3. **Phase 3 — decommission:** `decommission-docs` (deps: all `migrate-*`) →
   `repoint-references`.
4. **Phase 4 — guardrails:** `drift-prevention-ci`.

Stories are enumerated in §Stories but **not yet scaffolded** — they get
materialized at execution kickoff (this RFC is the plan doc; scaffolding the
~20 story files is the first execution step, gated on accepting the plan).

## Open questions

1. **`parity-verification.md`.** It's a reference/how-to (parity pipelines), not
   a backlog. Cutover says "no work tracking in docs," but this is closer to the
   deviation guides under `packages/website/docs/`. Options: (a) move it to
   `packages/website/docs/guides/` as true reference; (b) fold its residual
   "add fixtures / format bump" steps into the fixtures RFC and delete; (c)
   allowlist it as the one surviving `docs/` reference. Recommend (a).
2. **`launch-roadmap.md` home.** It's the P0 cross-cutting "what blocks launch"
   doc that every other doc feeds. As an RFC it's more of a meta-index than a
   work cluster. Make it a meta-RFC that links the others, or model it as the
   `tasks` repo's top-level `index.md` framing? Recommend a thin meta-RFC.
3. **In-flight RFC 0011.** A config-fidelity RFC is already on a PR branch.
   Confirm it doesn't overlap any doc in the disposition table before
   finalizing numbers, to avoid a collision at `finalize-rfc`.
4. **Spawn-loop coupling.** Confirm whether `tasks/tooling/tasks-loop` (and any
   trails skill) currently reads `docs/` paths; if so, `repoint-references`
   must land in the same change that deletes those docs to avoid a broken loop.
