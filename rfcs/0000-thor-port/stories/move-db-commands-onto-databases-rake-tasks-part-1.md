## Context

Rails defines `db:*` as Rake tasks in
`vendor/rails/v8.0.2/activerecord/lib/active_record/railties/databases.rake` (626 lines), over
`ActiveRecord::Tasks::DatabaseTasks`. trails defines them as commander subcommands in
`packages/trailties/src/commands/db.ts` (992 lines) over the same `DatabaseTasks` port. Commander cannot be retired while
they live there. This part moves: create / drop / migrate / rollback / forward / version / migrate:up / migrate:down / migrate:redo / migrate:status (`db.ts:539-700,803-870`).

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Each task is defined through the Rake DSL with `databases.rake`'s name, `desc`,
      prerequisites (`load_config`, `:environment`) and body, calling `DatabaseTasks` as the `.rake`
      body does. The multi-db `db:migrate:<name>` / `db:create:<name>` task generation follows the
      `.rake` loops.
- [ ] The corresponding `db.ts` commander code is deleted, and `bin/trails db:<task>` reaches
      the task through `RakeCommand`.
- [ ] The existing `db` command tests keep passing through the new path.
