## Context

RFC 0176 is the ActionView closer: actionview test parity is 1051/2562 (41%) at trails `94b071b93d`
(`pnpm parity:test --package actionview`). These Rails test files have missing tests and no open story:

| Rails test file                                                                | Rails tests | Matched | Missing | trails file                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `vendor/rails/v8.0.2/actionview/test/actionpack/controller/view_paths_test.rb` | 14          | 5       | 9       | `packages/actionview/src/actionpack/controller/view-paths.test.ts` |

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Every missing test in the files above is ported at the convention path, with the Rails test name verbatim.
- [ ] A test whose subject is unported either drives the port in this PR or is filed as a story naming the method it waits on, with this story's tests parked as `it.skip` pointing at it.
- [ ] Permanently unportable arms are parked as `it.skip` under a `PERMANENT-SKIP:` line citing the ratified CLAUDE.md section.
- [ ] `pnpm parity:test --package actionview` shows the missing count above go to zero for these files.
