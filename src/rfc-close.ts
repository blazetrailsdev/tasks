/**
 * Auto-close an RFC when its last story lands.
 *
 * An RFC with nothing left to do stayed `active` until a human noticed and
 * opened a PR flipping its frontmatter. Until then it kept showing up in the
 * spawn loop's active set and on the RFC page as live work, and `ready`
 * queried it every pass for stories that no longer existed.
 *
 * The rule is registered as a trails `afterSave` on Story, not bolted onto
 * each verb: every path that lands a story — `done`, `close`, `status`, and
 * ingest closing a story whose file was deleted — goes through a record save,
 * so all four get the close for free and none of them can forget it. That is
 * also why the mutation verbs save the loaded record instead of calling
 * `Relation#updateAll`: update_all skips callbacks, so a verb written that way
 * is invisible to this rule.
 *
 * Imports the model MODULES rather than the `models/index.js` barrel: the
 * barrel is what registers this callback, and going back through it would be
 * an import cycle. Nothing here traverses an association, so it does not need
 * the barrel's registration.

 * `active` at all times. Closing it makes the very next fixer story fail
 * validation ("closed RFC has a non-terminal story"), the CLI refuses to file
 * it, and the CI fixer silently wedges — this is what happened on 2026-07-29.
